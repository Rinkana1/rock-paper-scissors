# Rock Paper Scissors Project
I'm creating a Rock Paper Scissors program for The Odin Project

## Tasks
*  ~~Write a function `computerPlay()` that randomly returns 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'~~
* ~~Write a function `playRound()` that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors.~~
    * Two Parameters to take:
        * `playerSelection`
            * Parameter must be case-insensitive
            * Use `prompt()` to get user input
        * `computerSelection`
    * Winner declared with message such as `"You Lose! Paper beats Rock"`
* ~~Write function `game()` that plays 5 rounds~~
    * Allowed to use loops if necessary
* ~~`console.log()` the results of each round and the winner at the end~~
* Will add a GUI later, but not during this project

## June 22, 2021 Update
* Simple GUI added, no CSS
* Reworked program to use DOM elements instead of `console.log`
